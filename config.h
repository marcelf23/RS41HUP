// *********** Power Saving ******************
//
// Power Consumption Notes (all @ 3V):
// - GPS Max Performance, Transmitting @ 13 dBm = ~150 mA
// - GPS Max Performance, Not Transmitting = 70-90mA
// - GPS in PowerSave Mode, Transmitting @ 13 dBm = ~120 mA
// - GPS in PowerSave Mode, not Transmitting = 30-50mA, depending on GPS state.
// If enabled, transmit incrementing tones in the 'idle' period between packets.
// This will only function if ONLY MFSK is enabled.
// Note, you need to COMMENT this line out to disable this, not just set it to 0
#define CONTINUOUS_MODE 1

// Delay *between* transmitted packets (milliseconds)
// If you only have MFSK_4 enabled, and MFSK_CONTINUOUS (below) is disabled,
// Then the transmitter will turn off between transmissions. This saves about 50mA of power consumption.
// The maximum TX_DELAY is 65535*(1000/BAUD_RATE), so about 655.35 seconds for 100 baud
#define TX_DELAY  1000

// If defined, transmit a short 20ms 'pip' between transmissions every X milliseconds.
// This number needs to be smaller than TX_DELAY
// Comment out the line to disable this.
//#define TX_PIP  5000

// *********** Morse Ident **********************

// *********** Deep Sleep Mode ******************
// Deep Sleep Mode intended for long duration flights only!
//
// Notes:
// - Only have MFSK transmissions enabled.
// - Disable continuous mode.
// - Disable GPS powersave mode. 
//
// Power consumption in sleep mode = 32mA @ 3V
//
// In this mode, the GPS is turned into a sleep mode in between transmissions.
// During this sleep period, we sent one 'pip' every few seconds.
// At the end of the sleep period, the GPS is powered back up, and we await the GPS
// to obtain a fix before transmitting our position. While waiting for GPS lock, we
// send a 'double pip'.

// Go to sleep for X minutes between transmissions.
// In this time, the GPS will be completely powered down.
// If defined, sleep for this many minutes between transmissions.
